                    65 Billion

That’s the amount of messages being sent on WhatsApp everyday.

From App ratings. WhatsApp is the app that has the least uninstall rate (6%) and it has been installed over 5 billion times.

Yes, FIVE BILLION.

Even though the population of the world is 7.5 Billion, only about 3.5 Billion of those people are online.

It is not everyone that uses WhatsApp, but Five Billion downloads is pretty impressive to me. It is one of the Apps with a solid pool of humans.

And that fact brings us to our topic for today.

How can you tap into that pool of humans and create some form of income for yourself.... <a href="https://ajulu.substack.com/p/how-to-build-a-brand-on-whatsapp" target="_blank">continue reading</a></h5></p>

                   <p>These were the words that Gary Vaynerchuk uttered in a conference when he was asked to drop three words that could motivate anyone.
                    
                    It ended up being five words, but there are the most motivating five words I have ever heard since “come and carry your food”.
                    
                    What Gary was trying to say was that we waste time pondering on the things that we are meant to do, trying to get it all perfect in our heads before we launch out.
                    
                    You would never know how viable an idea is until you start.
                    
                    I have discovered that most times we are experts at coming up with excuses on why we can’t do the things that really matter to us and our future... <a href="https://ajulu.substack.com/p/the-secret-to-focusing-on-the-things">continue reading</a></p>
